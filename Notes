static keyword:
static is a keyword that can be used with varibales, methods, classes etc. when we use this keyword
with a variable that variable becomes static variables. when we use it with methods those methods become
static methods.
static variables:
can be accessed in all types of methods(instance, static). They can also be accessed in multiple objects
of a class.
static methods:
static methods can have same behaviour across all the instances of a class because no instance fields are allowed
inside the static methods.
Note:
1.) We can call the methods by just writing their name if we are in the same class. However if we are in a different
class we need to write class before the method name if we want to call it.
Access Modifiers:
Access controls the access of entities like variables methods. There are 4 access levels in java.
1.) private
2.) protected
3.) default
4.) public
There are 3 keywords in java that can be used to apply access levels.
private:
If we write private keyword with any variable method constructor etc no one else outside of that class can access it.
default:
All the entities with default access can be accessed within the same class as well as in any other class
within the same package
protected:

public:
If something is public all the classes in a project can access it.

How do we decide the access level
=============================================
1.) fields/properties/instance variables are almost always created as private.
2.) methods 70 - 80% of the time are declared public
3.) 90% class are declared public
